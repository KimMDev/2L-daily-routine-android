## Description
The product measures your water intake with a weight sensor and sends it to a Bluetooth-connected app. 
Based on this data, the app calculates, visualizes, and shows your daily intake. 
When the user achieves the recommended intake, the app sends a congratulatory notification to help build a healthy habit. 
It is also convenient to check the connection and charging status with LED indicators.

1. The weight sensor accurately detects the weight of water and sends it to the app in real time, allowing users to accurately determine their water intake
2. Bluetooth-connected apps automatically collect and visualize water intake data to make it easier to check user's water intake patterns
3. Encourage the formation of healthy habits with celebratory reminders when achieving the goal of drinking 2L water per day
